      "description": "I have served with the club since the it was chartered in 2015. Until this year, middle schoolers were rare in the club, so my board and I took the initiative to grow our club. I founded and organized the annual Leo 5k Run as the Race Director in order to address our various global causes, and I am proud that it has been a success and expanded our club within the district. I also created this website for our Leos as well as anyone wishing to serve his or her community as a Leo! I have personally seen and experienced growth in each Leo and love volunteering together as a family."
